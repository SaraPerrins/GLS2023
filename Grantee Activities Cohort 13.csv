During PY3, 100 Goal 3 participants completed the virtual LivingWorks Start training across 23 organizations (p 11)

Organizations that received gatekeeper and clinical training included several community mental health, school districts, behavioral health clinics and health care systems. (p 11)

Goal 3 focuses on Michigan's youth serving workforce. For Goal 3, the application states that, with the Michigan Public Health Institute  training center, they will annually underwrite ASIST and AMSR trainings. Communities will be able to apply to host these trainings. Priority in PY1 will be given to communities that agree to prioritize staff and providers affiliated with Michigan schools and public behavioral health agencies. 

Staff and volunteers have attended trainings, such as ASIST, providing them with the skills necessary to better support the young people Ozone House serves (Ozone House is in Ypsilanti, Washentaw County, MI).","ED1 Detroit, MI; Detroit Wayne Integrated
